# Oslo Kotlin Meetup 05.11.18 - Testing in Kotlin - and YOU!
Testing in Kotlin and YOU! Code examples and slides from my presentation. Code is meant to be educational, not perfectly structured :) 

* the `master`-branch contains code as it was before the meetup. If you want, you can use the code here to experiment with writing tests. 
* the `meetup-coding`-branch contains the solutions as we live-coded in the meetup. 


## Extra resources
